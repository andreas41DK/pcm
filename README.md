### FAQ:
#### If you can't find your computer or can't connect to it and WiFi network for both devices is the same
- turn off third-party firewall / antivirus or add a new exception.

#### If the computer you're using uses a third-party firewall (for example supplied with Antivirus)
- add exceptions for ports:

1. `TCP: 137, 139, 8080`
2. `UDP: 137`

**note:** Only TCP 8080 can be linked to the "PCManagerUIClient.exe" application, other ports need to be opened without reference to the application.
